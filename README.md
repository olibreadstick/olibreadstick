# Olivia Cardillo  
Software Engineer exploring reinforcement learning, human-machine systems, and AI-driven simulations.

👩‍💻 Software Engineering (B.Eng.) – Third Year Student

🎓 B.Sc. & M.Sc.A. in Physiotherapy

I build **AI-powered systems, biomechanical simulations, and human-centered software** that bridge engineering and real-world impact.

My background in **physiotherapy, biomechanics, and software engineering** allows me to approach problems from both a computational and human perspective, designing systems that are technically robust and biologically informed.
